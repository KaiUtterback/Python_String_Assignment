Task 1: Code Correction
You are provided with a scripot that is supposed to format customer names by ensuring the first letter is
uppercase and the rest are lowercase, regardless of how the data was entered.
However, the script contains errors. Correct the script so that it functions as intended.

Task 2

Write a function that checks a list of email addresses for a SaaS application's user accounts. 
The function should verify that each email contains an "@" symbol and a "." after it, indicating a valid email format. 
If an email doesn't meet this criterion, print it out for further review.

Task 3:

Create a script that generates a username for each new user.
